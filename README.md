# TrickOrTreat
A NodeJS-powered Slack chat bot that hands out candy!
##Currently Being Re-written
 - I'm curently re-building this bot from scratch - please feel free to play with it, but don't expect it to fully work yet.
 - Check Out the Legacy folder for the older - non promised bot. It was too hard to maintain, and I've learned a lot with node js since last working on this project.

##Quick Start
 - npm install
 - Copy the contents of config.TEMPLATE and create a file called config.js in the root directory of your project. Fill out missing variables with your Slack API token and your database infomation.
 - node app.js
