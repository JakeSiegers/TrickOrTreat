# TrickOrTreat
A node-powered Slack chat bot that hands out candy!
##Quick Start
 - npm install
 - create a file called "tokenfile" in root directory of the project. Put your Slack auth token in there. You can use a bot token, or your own user token if you'd like. If you use your own user token, messages from this bot will use your account to post them.
 - node app.js
